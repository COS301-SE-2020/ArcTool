# ArcTool
## Project Description
ArcTool is built for efficiency and ease, it aims to make the architect's job easy which in turn will make everyone's work easier. It does this by accepting and processing functional requirements written in a natural language, either structured or unstructured. With the functional requirements being specified, it then processes the JavaDoc to identify requirement patterns with the aim of reusing already established solutions from a Software-Portfolio. These solutions are then used to construct a meta-model, a model that is later used to generate a component diagram and/or an interaction diagram.

I am a final BSc Computer Science student who is broad-minded, hardworking and possessesself-discipline. I intend to use my skills in database systems (MariaDB) for the implementation of the storage requirements of the application, my Java knowledge for the API, and the skills I have in UX design to build an intuitive and efficient user interface for the application. I can easily adapt to new technologies and have an eagerness to learn, hence I plan to equip myself with all the necessary skills required to ensure the success of this project.
